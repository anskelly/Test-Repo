# Test-Repo
Repo to test git commands and pull requests.

Try to fork this repo (so you have a copy of it under your account), then clone it to your computer (so you can make edits to it), then pull it (to update your computer version from your account version - this is unnecessary when you have just cloned, but it's usually good practice to always pull right before editing so you don't accidentally work on an out-of-date version), then make edits (you will need a text editor - Mac has a built in one called TextEdit, but I like SublimeText), then commit (put your edit in a folder of "changes to upload"), then push (upload changes to your account), then submit a pull request (ask me to review your changes).
